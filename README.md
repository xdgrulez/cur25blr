Presentation at Current 2025 Bangalore "Kafka Superpowers for Your Jupyter Notebook and Python"

Presented on March 19, 2025.

## Abstract

You love Jupyter Notebooks and Python? This session shows you how to also do all kinds of Kafka-related tasks - directly in your Jupyter Notebook. The key for a seamless Kafka/Python/Jupyter Notebook experience is the Open Source library "kafi", the "Swiss Army Knife" for Kafka. We will show you how to cover all of the following use cases (and more) with "kafi" in your Jupyter Notebook, each with only a tiny number of lines of Python code: 

* Kafka administration 
* Schema Registry administration 
* Kafka Backups 
* Simple stream processing 
* Microservices/agents 
* Building a bridge from Kafka to Pandas dataframes/files (e.g. turn a Kafka topic into a Pandas dataframe or Parquet file)

After this session, many Kafka use cases that might have been terrifying for you before will have turned into easy as pie.
